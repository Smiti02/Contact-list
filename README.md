## How It Works

1. **App.jsx**
   - Manages states (`contacts`, `loading`, `error`)
   - Loads contacts from `localStorage` or mock data
   - Saves all updates to `localStorage`

2. **ContactList.jsx**
   - Displays each contact in a card layout with icons

3. **AddContactForm.jsx**
   - Collects and validates new contact data

4. **Loader.jsx**
   - Simple loading spinner shown during simulated API delay

## 🧠 Persistent Storage

Contacts are stored locally using the **browser’s localStorage**.  
To manually delete all saved contacts:
1. Open DevTools → Application Tab  
2. Select your site under **Local Storage**  
3. Delete the `contacts` key  
4. Refresh the browser to see default contacts again  

Or just open your browser console and run:
```js
localStorage.clear();

#Responsive Design Highlights
Device	Behavior
Desktop	Grid layout with larger padding

Mobile	Single column cards, full-width buttons

The responsiveness is handled using:

@media (max-width: 768px) { ... }
@media (max-width: 480px) { ... }

Key Learnings

React functional components & hooks (useState, useEffect)

Passing props between parent and child components

Persisting data using LocalStorage

Responsive design with CSS Grid & Flexbox

Writing modular, maintainable React code
